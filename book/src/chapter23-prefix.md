This started out as part of section 2, but I realized it was a *large*, open topic. The larger roguelike games, such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Cogmind, Caves of Qud, etc. all have a variety of maps. Section 3 is all about map building, and will cover many of the available algorithms for procedurally building interesting maps.
